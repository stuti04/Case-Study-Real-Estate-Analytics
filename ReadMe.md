## Case Study: Real Estate Analytics

### Project Description 

This case study revolves around performing exploratory data analysis on a real estate agency's data to help the agency understand their business's performance and provide them with actionable metrics to enhance their decision-making. 
To achieve this, the following steps were performed: 

* Business Requirements & Conceptual Data Modelling: The first step of this case study was to understand the requirements and map them to a conceptual data model.

* Creating the Relational Data Model: The conceptual data model created using EER and UML class diagram was then mapped to a relational model.     

* Data Gathering: For this project, the data was gathered/generated from different sources such as Zillow's website and Excel. 

* Loading Data: After collecting the data, it was loaded into MySQL and MongoDB databases.

* Data Pre-pocessing: Columns like the date columns had to be modified after loading into the database to make the data types suitable for MySQL. 

* Data Analysis: In this step, the data was analyzed using SQL, MongoDB Query Language, and Python. 

* Data Visualization: Finally, the findings of the previous steps were visualized using Python.
