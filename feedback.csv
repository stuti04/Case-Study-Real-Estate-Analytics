1,2022-06-19,Belia Skett,Allyn Jansie,2.0,Allyn was very stand offish and wasn't very available for a lot of the tours. We missed out on quite a few good apartments and found out later that they were sold by other agents to other clients.,1001,872-60-9397
2,2022-01-17,Lavinie Alvar,Demetri Grishakin,2.0,"While the listings they came up with looked good in pictures, the houses weren't that attractive in person. It made us lose trust in the agent when they said that's how the business functions.",1002,499-36-8432
8,2022-03-02,Dev Dunbobin,Barnard Akitt,5.0," Barnard Akitt was ALWAYS available for home tours. Their responsiveness was incredible. If they didn’t pick up, they always call back no longer than 5 minutes later. Seriously. I purchased a newly constructed condo so it wasn’t a straightforward deal. They told me that going in and highlighted the concerns they had and the research they wanted to do to make sure progress was being made and I wouldn’t have to wait for a long time to move in. ",1008,791-02-5013
4,2021-12-18,Andriette Fernandes,Charles Vearncomb,2.0,I did not appreciate the delay that their laziness caused in the apartment buying. I had to rent another place for 6 months before I ever bought the apartment in the Cortland area.,1004,577-56-6135
5,2022-10-07,Stephie Androli,Torey Manntschke,2.5,Worst service in Amsterdam NY.,1005,177-10-1755
6,2022-03-31,Shelton Stanbrooke,Franklin Jorg,2.5,"We weren't informed about the process thoroughly, the affair of selling our house costed us signoficantly more than originally decided due to the lack of knowledge and communication on Jessika's end.",1006,401-88-9744
16,2022-02-28,Danit Dinsell,Franklin Jorg,5.0,"From the first time I reached out to Franklin, he answered immediately and from there on out he was very responsive. He was a true professional. During negotiations we always felt like he had our best interest in mind. We have and will continue to recommend her to all of our family and friends who want to sell.",1006,519-29-9539
17,2022-01-24,Mason Cozins,Ashlee Trayte,5.0,"I am a first-time home buyer. I had no idea about every step of the process whatsoever when I first started taking a look at homes, or what to expect throughout the process. I also work in the service industry and am very aware that it is wildly important to ensure that: (1) your clients have the necessary information to make informed decisions (whether small or big, like purchasing a house); and (2) that their expectations are established appropriately and met. Ashlee exceeded in both aspects.",1007,241-36-8494
26,2022-11-03,Cullan Cousin,Demetri Grishakin,5.0,"Personally, as being “emotionally” invested as well in buying a home, having someone who properly set, managed, and came through with: expectations was such a lifesaver and made me feel so at ease throughout the entire process. And on a related note, as a first-time home buyer, I’m not sure what to expect, what’s good/bad, etc., and they were always so candid and provided their own perspective of different aspects of each home that they thought would be relevant to my decision making based on what they had learned about me.",1002,865-16-9392
9,2022-04-22,Jamima de Wilde,Baillie Charpling,4.5,Baillie will work with you to make your desires a reality. She is also very well versed at dealing with other real estate agents when there were disagreements about certain verbiage in documents. She is a go-to if you're looking for real estate in the Hudson area. ,1009,247-59-3402
11,2022-07-22,Hally Lawday,Jessika Caesman,2.0,It was a very bad experience as they had no advice on how to improve my home in order to get more value out of it. ,1011,729-08-1821
12,2022-07-06,Townie Pennetta,Demetri Grishakin,2.0,Never selling through them again.,1002,806-83-2548
13,2022-03-20,Gene Buckmaster,Thekla O'Hanley,1.5,After buying the property I found that there's other real estate agencies who sold apartments in the same area for a cheaper price. Worst negotiator ever.,1003,119-63-9318
14,2022-08-28,Betta Pittendreigh,Charles Vearncomb,4.5,"Charles was patient and worked through some tough situations without breaking a sweat. Their cool, calm mindset kept my anxiety low and gave me the confidence they would get the job done – and they did! Their promptness, knowledge of the market, strategic mindset, kindness, good energy made a potentially chaotic purchase process simple. I’ve already recommended him to two of my good friends. ",1004,837-60-3752
15,2022-06-21,Lindsy Margiotta,Torey Manntschke,1.0,I was lied to about the apartments available and the charges that were going to be applied throughout the sale.,1005,451-72-7469
22,2022-08-01,Dieter Ralling,Tallie Tesyro,4.5,"Great environment, professional and nice people, clean and beautiful office set up. They care about their clients and train their agents frequently so they are always updated with what’s going on in the market. I recommend Tallie to anyone looking to sell their apartment.",1012,698-88-0859
25,2022-04-18,Sterling Raspin,Allyn Jansie,4.5,Sterling is the best! She was thorough and professional and great to work with. She kept us apprised about available appointments and always let us know as soon as a new one came on the market. She was honest and forthright- no games.,1001,565-35-3897
43,2022-08-09,Elvira Mogie,Ashlee Trayte,4.5,"Ashlee was recommended to us by a friend, and we could not be happier with the
advice and service we received from her while buying one condo and selling another
in the competitive New York market. She really knows the local market and gave us a good sense of what would eventually become available and how much it would probably cost. She was also very creative on finding and recommending cheaper properties that could potentially be renovated to meet our criteria.",1007,136-67-3039
46,2022-09-04,Burty Mugridge,Bari Semper,4.5,"Bari was always available to provide me with the information that I needed (or didn’t need, but needed for the sake of my sanity) – every decision that I made, small or big, mattered to them. Not only did I feel like I had all the information I need to make those decisions, but I also felt like I was in good hands",1010,883-17-0086
20,2022-09-22,Burr Beyn,Bari Semper,1.5,"I wasn't too happy with the listings that I was shown, and my budget was absolutely not respected at all.",1010,735-89-9560
21,2021-12-04,Wade Pauli,Jessika Caesman,1.5,The contract I signed wasn't explained to me entirely and the mortgage option I was sold on was not the best out there. At the end whe I found out there was no way to get out of the problem.,1011,459-58-9680
7,2022-10-19,Lida Caudelier,Ashlee Trayte,4.0,Lida Caudelier was truly exceptional. I met them at a home buying seminar that was focused on the Buffalo area. She helped me find the perfect home and it was a breeze working with her.,1007,769-02-8612
23,2022-10-01,Kelcey Lambdon,Normy Kerins,4.0,"On meeting Normy the first time they didn’t talk down to me after telling them, “We don’t have a clue about this whole process…”, in fact, they came prepared with a calming and professional demeanor and spoke to us like we were buddies heading out for a picnic. They will come across like your long-time neighbor, and that’s an added bonus. ",1013,882-33-4687
24,2021-12-25,Richy Crumbie,Randi Parkhouse,3.0,They were of decent help in finding the apartment. I have since realized that the process could have been smoother and the negotiations could have swayed my way a little more.,1014,745-10-8866
28,2022-07-30,Tito Alabone,Ashlee Trayte,4.0,"When we found our dream home, there was already one more offer on it and they were going to decide that night. Ashlee and their associate agent helped convince them to wait until the next afternoon to make a decision, so we could submit our offer. ",1007,624-44-8693
32,2022-04-04,Ynes Gommey,Thekla O'Hanley,4.0,We felt like we were working with our best friend rather than a real estate agent. ,1003,834-76-9671
34,2022-01-27,Jacques Prin,Torey Manntschke,4.0,They made the selling process so easy and helped me understand what was happening every step of the way. We moved to Florida in the middle of the sale and Torey went above and beyond to go to the house and check on it while we were away.,1005,578-33-2781
36,2022-08-01,Lewes Riepl,Bari Semper,4.0," My wife hates surprises and being blindsided but it was Bari's sincerity and their quick response to our concerns that kept my wife calm. Basically, they took care of things right away",1010,480-20-5857
29,2022-11-15,Persis Darque,Barnard Akitt,2.0,They never have time to address your issues and they make an already stressful process every more stressful.,1008,704-68-0490
30,2022-04-22,Geordie Tabb,Jessika Caesman,1.5,They were up with us working on our offer into the early morning hours. They helped us figure out the best way to position our offer and what price to go in at to give us the absolute best chance that the sellers would accept our offer over the other one. ,1011,334-03-0836
31,2022-03-02,Peggy Boor,Normy Kerins,1.0,Normy has the worst work ethic I have seen.,1013,835-74-6455
40,2022-05-07,Kate Limpenny,Charles Vearncomb,4.0,"I worked with Charles – an excellent agent. He listed my place in April and we were on contract in 3 months, at asking price. He is an excellent negotiator with a very personalized touch. Highly recommended!",1004,130-88-6346
33,2022-06-15,Tricia Banner,Charles Vearncomb,2.5,Lot of the listings they shortlisted for me had already been sold. They kept saying it was a system issue but this caused a huge inconvinience and stress while looking for a house.,1004,407-73-9873
45,2022-01-09,Kim Colquit,Baillie Charpling,4.0,"Baillie realized we didn’t have anyone managing our finances or looking at what loans we could afford. They introduced us to Olivier Stennet at Wisozk-Herman Lending who significantly changed our lives and allowed us to dream again. Once we had our finances in order and a budget to work with, Baillie helped us to dream again.",1009,798-73-6207
35,2022-07-08,Florrie Bordiss,Franklin Jorg,1.0,"Selling isn't their strong suit. They did not find a lot of buyers even in 2 months, the listing wasn't getting any traction. The negotiations didn't go my way either.",1006,425-72-2721
3,2022-08-16,Celka Challenger,Thekla O'Hanley,3.5,Thekla was always available to answer our questions and to show us the apartment any time we asked for.,1003,580-08-4362
37,2022-03-19,Ynez Hardson,Allyn Jansie,1.5,I was selling 2 homes and the process was tricky since we needed the money from first before closing the second. Their lack of knowledge definitely bungled the whole situation and Franklin was ridiculously unavailable.,1001,890-96-0250
10,2022-10-17,Briano Dodd,Bari Semper,3.5,We get to appreciate Bari even more now as wonderful neighbors and became very good friends of ours! Would totally work with them again!,1010,879-17-2781

18,2022-05-30,Balduin Pawlowicz,Barnard Akitt,3.5,Barnard is a professional and experienced real estate agent. He was able to get us in an Apartment while I was traveling and made the process as smooth as possible.,1008,889-30-4906
41,2021-12-11,Nadeen Brahm,Torey Manntschke,3.0,They helped me sell my apartment however they took hours to respond to simple questions which resulted in losing a good deal.,1005,169-75-4282
42,2022-01-19,Anders Dow,Franklin Jorg,2.5,They couldn't even help me fogure out how much my home was worth. They didn't inform about the home improvements before hand and there were really high closing charges that I wasn't made aware of at the start.,1006,374-41-3572
19,2022-02-15,Mufi Wateridge,Baillie Charpling,3.5,Baillie was great at giving us the right advise and list of things needed to get takers and spike interest in our apartment.,1009,486-55-9800

27,2022-11-10,Ann Lanston,Charles Vearncomb,3.5,We just sold our home in Binghamton and had the pleasure to work with Charles. They made what could have been a stressful and difficult process as seamless as could be.,1004,139-54-8369
38,2022-07-01,Deana Laraway,Demetri Grishakin,3.5,"I was extremely busy with work but also moving states and luckily, I found Demetri. As housing is being snapped up in Syracuse, I would never have time to begin the entire process from Albany. They offered to tour the property via video, and they provided all details necessary. ",1002,587-98-1021
47,2022-07-31,Cele Enoksson,Jessika Caesman,2.0,I wasn't told that the closing costs would entirely fall on the seller's end. Jessika is lacking in negotiation skills and the knowledge of the process of selling a home. I am extremely unhappy with how the sale went.,1011,856-47-5916
48,2022-06-27,Richy Crumbie,Tallie Tesyro,3.5,"Tallie and their entire team were very helpful. If we ever need to sell our current home, we know exactly who to call when the time comes =)",1012,745-10-8866
49,2022-07-01,Sterling Raspin,Normy Kerins,3.5,"Normy was more than helpful in finding us an apartment in Auburn. He was extremely honest, upfront, and was able to find us a great apartment that fit right in our price range!",1013,565-35-3897
